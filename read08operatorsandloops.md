# LOOPS ON LOOPS ON LOOPS ON LOOPS
## DO - WHILE - FOR 
### All of these are associated with loops and loops help make counting and other calculations possible

    _ most complex (more than simple math) equations and calculations that are responses of questions will 
    require counting or an action to take place until two values are equal or solved are done so with loops

Loops are the part of javascript that use the operators that not many people initially understand nor do they 
like about js. 
Some of those operators include 

    1. && - for "and"
    2. || - for "or"
        and my personal favorite
    3. ! - for "not"

Loops are basically ways to count, and each different type of loop has a different way to exit the loop. 

    ### some of these ways are: 
        **for**
        **do**
        **do-while**

    These can all be tied in to and coupled with other things such as arrays.
