# ITS TIME TO GIT GOING!!!!! :rowboat: :rowboat: :rowboat:


## an all inclusive tour of git and the world of revision control

As every student in @DeltaV Code 102 class has said at one point or another this week
  > What is git and why do we even need this 
  
  - **git** is, put simply, a **V**ersion **C**ontrol **S**ystem or _**VCS**_ for short
  
  _**what does version control do for my code?**_  :weary: you may ask....
    according to the training module for git found by clicking here at [udemy](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/)
    git version control is:
    
    Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through   version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.
  
  
  There are 3 types of version control once you get deeper into **git** 
  **Local Version Control** | **Centralized Version Control** | **Distributed Version Control**
  ------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------
  one database to store all changes to files |  same as LVC only multiple users or clients can access | allows clients to create mirrored repositories  
  original VCS created many years ago | streamlined the collaboration process | These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information |
 | allows programmers to have more knowledge of team membersâ€™ activities with certain files | programmers working in teams can collaborate with each other in various ways to complete a joint project | 
| gives administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges | enables the use of various simultaneous workflows
