  # * WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TEXT EDITOR AND AN IDE OR INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
   taken directly from the article _ CHOOSING A TEX EDITOR _ by The Older Coder on Jan, 11
   >A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text
wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It
wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If
you’ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed
that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all
in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one
software package.
