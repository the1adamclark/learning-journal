# USING HTML TO BUILD A WEBSITE 

## what is HTML and why do you need it to build a website?

 * HTML is _Hypertext Markup Language_ and was developed in the mid-to-late 90's as a way to help make websites more interactive between pages.

 * HTML is not a language but a structure for the code needed in webpage creation

 * HTML structure uses things called **tags** that act as containers to tell you something about the information that lies in between them
        * tags are also constructed in a specific way and must be used in such way to function properly, such as most all tags require an opening tag and a closing tag. Closing tags require a '/' be put within the tag like so: </p>
        * an opening tag looks just like this one only omits the '/'

## Another key component to HTML language and tags is that they carry **_attributes_** 

Attributes tell us more about the element (the complete sum of the tags and the text in between them)
    ** attributes must contain the following things 
        1. Name = often highlighted in a different color and very few can have multiple meanings
        2. Value = also highlighted in a differenc color and just as its name says it gives a meaningful value to the name.

    example of an attribute: <p lange"en-us">Paragraph in english </p>


## HTML works in the backround of a website in conjunction with CSS and javaScript.

# CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and will basically let you add color and designs to your website

# javaScript works with HTML and CSS to as functionality to your website or web pages.
