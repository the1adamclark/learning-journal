## In all reality all I should have to put here is that to program with js you need to have:

    _ **a complete outline of the process engineered and thought out on a whiteboard before even starting** _ 

    _HOWEVER!!!!!!_ 

    I will go in to more detail as to what it takes to properly exacute a program with JavaScript

      ### First thing you will need to understand about programming in js is it requires a different thought
      process and concept. 

      You will see things like:
        * Math reads from right to left
        * Evaluation rules appear to function differently 
        * some of the assignment operators can get confusing and not make sens
    Looking at it from the outside it appears you have to start at the end and work your way back to the beginnig.

    JavaScript is one of the most powerful coding languages availabe as well as one of the most widely used languages
    around and 1/3 of the Full Stack Developer language package requirements.
