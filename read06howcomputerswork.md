#THE WORLD IS JUST 1'S AND 0'S
## a breakdown of how a computer works

a computer is a simple machine that does complex things. All of the complex things a computer can do and all of the ways it
can do them can be broken down into four simple steps

  1.input
  2.storage
  3.processing
  4.output
  
even though this sounds simple a computer is doing this thousands of times over every second, making a simple task capable 
of accomplishing great tasks.

#BREAKING DOWN THE DATA
information is input as 1's and 0's that are sent to the cpu.
1 = on and 0 = off or 1 or on = true and 0 or off = false, these are the most common inputs
cpu then converts to the appropriate data for the "recieveing" end of the hardware (i.e. monitor, cnc machine etc.)
all the electric impusles of 1's and 0's are carried through the circuit board to micro chips where it is converted to 
action.
