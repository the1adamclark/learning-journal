#STRETCH GOALS FOR LAB03

What did I learn? or what did it teach me...
1.It gets easier the more you do it
2.I need to make my comments about why I made the change more than what the change was
3.Affective Commit comments pay dividends down the road when code maintenence is required
4.I also learned I did not have nearly enough experience in git anything...git, github, gitbash...git everything
5.Much like it was noted when choosing a code editor, I am now far more comfortable in VScode than in git becasue of familiarity
