# JUST A SPLASH OF COLOR AND STYLE WITH CSS

## What is CSS and what does it do for a website
  * CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and was originally introduced around 1996.
  * CSS adds color and style to a website so it does not look as bland and boring as a simple word document
  
### How does it work
    
    1. CSS associates style rules with HTML elements, meaninig via rules you can also add style and color to each part individually
    or to the entire page as a whole.
    
  * Color brings a page to life and also can set the mood of the user, define contrast for or add a level of activty to your page such
  as hyperlinks changing color after being viewed. I know that is one of my most recognized hidden benefits of CSS!
  
### When using CSS code you need to understand color a lot better, the world of **R**eds **G**reens and **B**lues classhes with the
worlds of **1's** and **0's** to creat _Hexadecimal_ numbers or _Hex Codes_. You can also just stick with the tried and true 
Color Names...however, there are only **147** registered names to choose from and far more colors in the world than that.

**CSS** like everything else in the coding world of web development and the world wide web, has been update with newer versions to 
add more capability to the software.

    * starting with CSS1 in 1996, they quickly developed CSS2 and the current update to CSS3 has been on going for years.
    
    
  ## where to add your CSS code.
  
        *generally speaking it is housed in a separate file that is called out in the first few lines of your HTML code,
          *it is done whtis way primarily because it gives you better control of the code and how it functions.
          * sometimes it will be included directly into the HTML pages with the sites are much simpler or are being 
          produced from a templated web building service, but even then it should still be limited in that practice.
          
  ## CSS3 introduced the use of _Opacity_ into the color seleciton adding RGBA and HSLA values as well.
